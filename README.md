Compared with traditional urban transportations, shared bikes have significant advantages, including low carbon emission(environmental friendly), healthier lifestyles, less traffic jams and convenience (especially for short distance traveling). According to what we can see in cities and data from Statista , the rental bike business has been thriving worldwide since 2012. More city governments and companies are working to provide such services and it is better for them to know how to allocate the bikes appropriately.

**A goal of this project** is to help predict the required number of rental bikes required daily. We want to see what variables help determine the rented bikesâ€™ amount. The potential benefits of such a model are important not only for city development like public transportation and environmental stability but also for the company's efficiency of allocating bikes (i.e. inventory management). Decision makers could be governmental sectors and/or rental bikes companyâ€™s shareholders.
